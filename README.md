## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **AI Based Chatbot for Schools and Training Institutes**, developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP)**.

The system is designed to automate **front-desk and inquiry handling operations** of educational institutes by responding to student queries related to **admissions, courses, fees, and schedules** using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Educational institutes often receive a large number of repetitive inquiries from students and parents. Handling these inquiries manually increases workload on administrative staff and results in delayed responses.

This project proposes an **AI-powered chatbot** that acts as an **automated receptionist**, capable of answering queries instantly and operating **24/7 without human intervention**.

The chatbot is implemented using:
- **Google Dialogflow** for NLP and intent detection  
- **Python Flask** for backend processing  
- **MySQL** for data storage and management  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate student inquiry handling  
- Reduce workload on administrative staff  
- Provide 24/7 assistance to students  
- Securely store admission-related data  
- Implement NLP-based intelligent responses

### Architecture Flow

1. User interacts with the chatbot interface  
2. Dialogflow processes the message using NLP  
3. Intent is detected and sent to Flask backend via webhook  
4. Backend performs logic and database operations  
5. Response is returned to Dialogflow  
6. User receives the final response
